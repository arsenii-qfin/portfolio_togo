                Portfolio ToGo is an interactive web app designed for fun purposes! This is by no means a full stack application, rather a personal project.
                And yet, the app provides various visulaizations and great surface-level insight into the user defined portfolio of stocks. I encourage you to answer
                three quantitative finance questions on the right (update on reload), and then see "How to Use" for further steps.
